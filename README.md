# LidEdMe
This is a thing that suggests what courses to take to fulfill a lib-ed requirement at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. And by suggest, I mean picks at random based on filtered data.

## Who made this?

I made this. I'm [Max Fierke](https://www.maxfierke.com). I do lots of web things. I also do some other stuff. I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/m4xm4n) and [GitHub](https://github.com/maxfierke) and stuff.

## Who provides the data?

The data is provided by the University of Minnesota's Academic Support Resources and is provided through an API made by Ian Whitney, who has been very nice and helpful in implementing things I want.

## Is this like a real thing?

Despite the fact that I am an employee of the University of Minnesota (student worker, but still), I am also a student, and I made this in my free time. This is in no way supported or owned by the University of Minnesota. Do not contact them about this. I'm just using the data that they are graciously providing.
